eHireMe is a native Android/iOS mobile application developed to simplify the
hiring process for local small businesses around the nation. By allowing
users to create a detailed profile, we give small businesses the easiest way
to view potentional cantidates and make quick decisions about who to extend an 
interview to.  

Most of the inspiration was drawn from Tinder, and the UI of both Native applications was built to function like it.

The node scripts were hosted on Heroku, and maintained by myself.
