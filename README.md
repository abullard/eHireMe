eHireMe was designed to connect local businesses with potential employees. Given information about the applicant that applies for a listed job, the small business could then extend an offer to talk on the phone, and possibly set up a time for an interview.

Most of the inspiration was drawn from Tinder, and the UI of both Native applications was built to function like it.

The node scripts were hosted on Heroku, and maintained by myself.
